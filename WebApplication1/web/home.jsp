        <h1>Take a pledge to donate your eyes</h1>
        <strong>Do you know that we can light the life of a blind person by donating
            our eyes after our death?
</strong>
        <p> In India, we have an estimated 4.6 million people with corneal blindness
            that is curable through corneal transplantation made possible by eye donation.
            More than 90% of the corneal transplantation is carried out successfully
            and helps restore vision in people with corneal blindness. Corneal
            transplantation in infants born with cloudy cornea can make a big
            difference to their lives.</p>

        <strong><h3>Some frequently asked questions</strong></h3>
        <strong>Who can be eye donors?</strong>
        <p>Anyone from the age of one. There is no age-limit for donating the eye.
            All one needs to do is bequeath his or her eyes by taking a simple pledge
            to donate the eyes after death. While taking a pledge during ones lifetime
            itself is a noble deed, it requires the support of the relatives or friends
            to carry out the wishes of eye donation of the deceased.People using
            spectacles and those diagnosed with diabetes and hypertension can donate their eyes.
        </p>

        <strong>Whom should we contact to donate eyes?</strong>
        <p>Eyes need to be removed within six hours after death and so it is important to get
           in touch with your nearest eye bank at the earliest.</p>
